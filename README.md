# Ridge-Regression
Tikhonov regularization, named for Andrey Tikhonov, is the most commonly used method of regularization of ill-posed problems. 
In statistics, the method is known as ridge regression,in machine learning it is known as weight decay,
and with multiple independent discoveries, it is also variously
known as the Tikhonov–Miller method, the Phillips–Twomey method,
the constrained linear inversion method, and the method of linear regularization.

# Lasso-Regression
In statistics and machine learning, lasso (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator; also Lasso or LASSO) 
is a regression analysis method that performs both variable selection and 
regularization in order to enhance the prediction accuracy and interpretability of 
the statistical model it produces. It was originally introduced in geophysics 
literature in 1986,[1] and later independently rediscovered and popularized in
1996 by Robert Tibshirani,[2] who coined the term and provided further insights
into the observed performance.
